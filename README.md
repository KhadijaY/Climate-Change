# Climate-Change
Introduction Page

This Data Applications assignment is looking at the trends of CO2 Emissions in countries around the world, as it is something that is impacting our enivornment significally, resulting in an increase of harsh weather, like droughts and etc. This is concerning to this generation and the next as we are a more globalized generation that heavily relies on cars, gas, deforestation, meaning that Co2 emissions will impact the next generations more significantly. I chose to focus on general Co2 emission levels and compared it to the years to see the trends, like if it had changed significantly whether that be positively or negatively.
